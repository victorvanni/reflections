 ? What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a respository it adds the essencial files of a repository,
like the configs and others metadata, so it can be recognized as a repository,
and that's also why we need to do it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ? How is staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
 What value do you think it offers?

The repository is something like a directory with some extra informations that
let us keep track of changes, the directory doesn't have such feature.
The staging area is the connection between the working directory and repository,
when you change something in the working directory it has to go to the staging
area so the commit can understand it and save the change history.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ? How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per
 logical change?

Instead of commiting every file at once you can add a set of files from a
logical change and commit it with a meaningful message, then repeat these steps
until all logical changes are commited.

 ? What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your
 history organized? How would branches help?

Some situations to separate into other branches would be when you are working
on something different, something additional that doesn't need to stop the
current development, like translanting the app or doing some experimental
feature.
