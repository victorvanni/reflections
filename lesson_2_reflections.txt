 ? What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a respository it adds the essencial files of a repository,
like the configs and others metadata, so it can be recognized as a repository,
and that's also why we need to do it.

 ? How is staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
 What value do you think it offers?

The repository is something like a directory with some extra informations that
let us keep track of changes, the directory doesn't have such feature.
The staging area is the connection between the working directory and repository,
when you change something in the working directory it has to go to the staging
area so the commit can understand it and save the change history.
