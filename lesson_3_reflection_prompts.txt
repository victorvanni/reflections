 ? When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
 work local?

It becomes interesting to use a remote repository when you want to work on
the same project in different computers or with different people, also, it is
a good way to keep a backup in the cloud, so it becomes harder to lost your
project.

 ? Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
 automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I think it is better to pull changes manually because it could happen to update
some changes that other people did and it could change something that you're
working on, creating some problems.
